## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned
On this project I have learnt about:
 - CSS variables
 - CSS selectors
 - box-sizing css property
 - Box Model
 - css over-flow property


### Continued development

I want to learn about certain css properties and HTML layout. My future focus would be:
- Layout (Flex, Box Model, div)
- Transition and Transform properties.
- Positions (z-index, absolute, relative,...)
